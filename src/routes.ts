// This file can be used for additional route definitions
// Currently, main routes are defined in server.ts for simplicity

// Example: Future admin routes

  // This could be expanded for admin dashboard functionality

// Example: Future webhook routes for external integrations

  // This could handle webhooks from external systems
  console.log("Webhook received:", req.body);
  res.json({ received: true });
});
